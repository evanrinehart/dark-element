Completely separating mathematics from mathematical language and hence from the
phenomena of language described by theoretical logic, recognising that
intuitionistic mathematics is an essentially languageless activity of the mind
having its origin in the perception of a move of time.

This perception of a move of time may be described as the falling apart of a
life moment into two distinct things, one of which gives way to the other, but
is retained by memory.

If the twoity thus born is divested of all quality, it passes into the empty
form of the common substratum of all twoities.

And it is this common substratum, this empty form, which is the basic intuition
of mathematics.
